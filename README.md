# Overall Purpose of the Project:

    Analyzing Racial and State-Specific Impact of COVID-19: The project aims to provide insights into how the
    pandemic has affected different racial groups within various states. It emphasizes the importance of disaggregating 
    data by race to understand the unequal impacts of the virus.

    Data Processing and Management: Through the CovidReader class, the project handles the initial stages of data management, 
    including reading, parsing, and storing COVID-19 data in a structured format.

    Data Analysis and Sorting: The FatalityCalculator class takes the structured data and provides functionality to analyze 
    and sort it, offering insights into fatality rates (Case Fatality Rate - CFR) among different racial groups.

    Interactive Data Visualization: The GUISpaceWindow class creates a graphical user interface, allowing users to interactively 
    engage with the data. This interface enhances the accessibility and comprehensiveness of the data.

    User Engagement and Education: By providing interactive elements like sorting options and state-specific data views, 
    the project educates its users about the pandemic's impact in an engaging manner.

# Output and Information Provided to Users:

    State-Specific COVID-19 Data: Users can view COVID-19 data for specific states, including infection and death counts 
    across different racial demographics.

    Comparative Analysis: The sorting functionalities allow users to view the data in different orders – alphabetically or 
    by CFR – facilitating a comparative analysis of the racial impact of the pandemic.

    Graphical Representation of Data: The project outputs the data in graphical formats (e.g., bar charts), making complex 
    statistics more digestible and easier to understand.

    Interactive Exploration: Users can interact with the data by selecting different states or sorting options, leading to 
    a more engaging and personalized exploration of the data.

    Educational Insight: The project provides valuable educational insights into the disparities and impacts of COVID-19 
    across different racial groups and states, highlighting areas that might require more focused public health interventions.

    Real-Time Data Updates: Through the GUI, the project can dynamically update the displayed data based on user interactions, 
    ensuring that the information presented is always aligned with the user's current queries.
